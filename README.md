# ng-flex-skunk

Skunkworks for a CSS-utility class based replacement for Angular Flex

See [Checklist](checklist.md)

## Overview

Provide CSS classes that can be combined with custom CSS properties as a way substitute most of the directives offered by the now deprecated Angular-Flex project, while still adhering to how flexbox works under the hood. (For example, you'll need to explicitly specify that you want your flex values to be percentages to match the behavior of the Angular-Flex directives)

Eventually, these will be paired with a set of Angular directives to allow controlling what classes and what CSS custom properties are applied to an element based on active responsive breakpoints.
